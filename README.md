**GiftAI** is a premium, AI-driven platform designed to take the stress out of gift-giving. By combining the reasoning power of **Google Gemini** with real-time commerce data from **Amazon**, GiftAI finds the perfect, most thoughtful gifts for your loved ones in seconds.

## 🧩 The Problem It Solves

Gift-giving is often a source of "decision paralysis" and anxiety. GiftAI addresses several key pain points:

### 1. Decision Paralysis
Most people spend hours scrolling through generic "Gift Guides for Men/Women" that don't actually fit the recipient. GiftAI replaces endless scrolling with **curated reasoning**, suggesting items that match a person's soul, not just a category.

### 2. The "Impersonal" Gift
Traditional e-commerce filters are rigid (Price, Category, Rating). GiftAI uses **Natural Language Understanding** to bridge the gap between a vague personality trait (e.g., *"they love quiet mornings and mechanical watches"*) and a physical product.

### 3. Outdated Recommendations
Generic blog posts often link to discontinued products. By integrating with the **live Amazon API**, we ensure every recommendation is currently in stock, priced accurately, and ready for Prime delivery.

### 4. The Message Mystery
Finding the gift is only half the battle. GiftAI's **Soulful Message Generator** solves the "blank card" problem by drafting heartfelt, personalized notes that explain the thought behind the gift.

## 💡 Practical Use Cases

- **Milestone Birthdays**: Find a gift that reflects a decade of growth and specific hobbies.
- **Relatable Anniversaries**: Discover something that celebrates a shared interest or a unique personality trait of your partner.
- **The "Hard to Buy For" Person**: Use AI to brainstorm niche interests that you might have overlooked.
- **Last-Minute Gifting**: Quickly identify high-rated Prime-eligible items that still feel deeply personal rather than rushed.

## 🧱 Challenges I Ran Into

Building an AI-driven commerce engine presented several unique technical hurdles:

### 1. The "Hallucination" Gap
**The Challenge**: Large Language Models (LLMs) like Gemini are great at brainstorming but can "hallucinate" products that don't actually exist or are discontinued.
**The Solution**: I moved from a "direct recommendation" approach to a **two-step discovery pipeline**. The AI now generates highly specific search queries and reasoning, which are then validated against the **live Amazon API**. If the AI suggests a "Moon-Dust Infused Yoga Mat," the search step ensures we only show the closest *real* high-rated equivalent.

### 2. API Latency & Rate Limiting
**The Challenge**: Fetching 10-12 different products from Amazon in a single request can be slow and often triggers rate limits.
**The Solution**: I implemented a **sequential fetching strategy with micro-delays (500ms)** and aggressive timeout handling (`Promise.race`). This ensures the UI remains responsive and we don't get blocked by external providers, while still delivering a rich set of results.

### 3. Interest Specificity
**The Challenge**: When a user inputs "Cricket," broad AI models tend to provide generic "Sports" items like generic gym bags.
**The Solution**: I engineered a strict **System Prompt hierarchy** that forbids broad category mapping. The engine is forced to use the user's exact keywords in its search queries (e.g., "Cricket Batting Gloves" instead of "Sports Protective Gear"), ensuring the results feel laser-focused on the user's intent.

### 4. Ensuring Zero-Downtime Reliability
**The Challenge**: Total reliance on the LLM means the app breaks if the Gemini API is down.
**The Solution**: I built a robust **Rule-Based Fallback System**. If the AI service fails for any reason, the app automatically switches to a pre-mapped catalog of interest-to-search-query pairs, ensuring the user *always* gets a helpful response.
